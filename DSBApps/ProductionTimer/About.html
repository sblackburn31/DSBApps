        <h1>Production Timer Emulator</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>What is This?</h2>
            This is an emulation of an actual factory production timer
            screen
            that is part of a larger and much more sophisticated
            system.  This has been presented to show off my programming abilities
            in creating a Web Application and to show that I can do Full stack
            development.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>How to Use?</h2>
            To use the app, select the <strong># EMPLOYEES</strong> and a <strong>WORK CELL</strong>,<br />
            then enter a number in the <strong>PRODUCTION #</strong> text box.<br />
            The only option from there is to either Clear, Pause or Start.<br /><br />
            Once you have started, the options are to Pause or End.<br /><br />
            Once you have paused you can unpause, select another pause or end.<br /><br />
            Once the End is selected the Productoin ends and the
            total time is displayed.
            <br />

            <h2>How was it Created?</h2>
            Technologies used in this application are, on the front-end, JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS, AJAX and Bootstrap.  On the back-end, this application makes
            REST calls to an ASP.Net MVC Web API that uses C# and Entity Framework
            to make calls to a SQL Server database that primarily uses Stored Procedures
            to retrieve and update data.
